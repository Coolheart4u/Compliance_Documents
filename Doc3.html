            <h2>Objective of the Reevaluation</h2>
            <p>The process of reevaluating individuals or entities identified as high risk is critical to maintaining the integrity and security of financial institutions. This includes individuals who held prominent positions as Politically Exposed Persons (PEPs) and those residing in countries listed on the FATF grey list. Reevaluation ensures ongoing compliance with international standards and effective risk management.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Key Information to Collect</h2>
            <p>The following details should be gathered to properly assess the risk associated with an individual or entity:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><span class="highlight">Personal and Employment History</span>: Determine the current and past roles of the individual, especially in government, state-owned enterprises, or military positions.</li>
                <li><span class="highlight">Source of Wealth</span>: Understanding the origin of an individual’s wealth helps assess any potential illicit financial flows.</li>
                <li><span class="highlight">Geopolitical Risk Assessment</span>: Review the risk associated with the individual’s country of residence, particularly if it is listed on the FATF grey list.</li>
                <li><span class="highlight">Ongoing Political Exposure</span>: For individuals who no longer hold a prominent PEP position, assess whether they maintain influential relationships or access to public office.</li>
                <li><span class="highlight">Family and Close Associates</span>: Evaluate the political and financial profiles of close family members and associates who may pose indirect risks.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

            <h2>Example of Key Information to Ask</h2>

            </div>
            <div class="box">

            </div>
            <div class="box">
                <p><span class="highlight">Example 3:</span> “Are there any ongoing business interests or relationships with individuals in the current government or public sectors?”</p>
            </div>
            <div class="box">
                <p><span class="highlight">Example 4:</span> “Can you clarify your relationship with individuals who hold or have held prominent political or business positions?”</p>

            <h2>Steps to Conduct a Thorough Risk Evaluation</h2>
            <p>When reevaluating high-risk individuals and entities, ensure the following steps are followed:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><span class="highlight">Step 1:</span> Gather and verify comprehensive background information on the individual or entity.</li>
                <li><span class="highlight">Step 2:</span> Conduct an in-depth review of their financial activities, including transactions, investments, and partnerships.</li>
                <li><span class="highlight">Step 3:</span> Cross-reference with local and international sanctions lists, PEP databases, and FATF grey list information.</li>
                <li><span class="highlight">Step 4:</span> Analyze the geographical risk factors of their country of residence or operations.</li>
                <li><span class="highlight">Step 5:</span> Assess ongoing business relationships that may represent elevated risks due to the individual’s political ties or status.</li>
                <li><span class="highlight">Step 6:</span> Regularly update the risk profile based on new intelligence, changes in political landscapes, or shifts in financial activity.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Documentation and Reporting</h2>
            <p>Ensure all findings from the reevaluation process are documented thoroughly. This includes:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><span class="highlight">Detailed Reports</span> summarizing the evaluation process and conclusions.</li>
